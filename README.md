2020 FBI HateCrime Data Analysis and Visualization to discover trends, retrieve insightful information, and visualize the data, to highlighting useful information and curate data into a form easier to understand.
# Methodology 
The Hate Crime Statistics Program of the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program collects data regarding criminal offenses that were motivated, in whole or in part, by the offender’s bias against the victim’s race/ethnicity/ancestry, gender, gender identity, religion, disability, or sexual orientation, and were committed against persons, property, or society. Because motivation is subjective, it is sometimes difficult to know with certainty whether a crime resulted from the offender’s bias. Moreover, the presence of bias alone does not necessarily mean that a crime can be considered a hate crime. Only when a law enforcement investigation reveals sufficient evidence to lead a reasonable and prudent person to conclude that the offender’s actions were motivated, in whole or in part, by his or her bias, should an agency report an incident as a hate crime.

# Data collection
The Hate Crime Statistics Program collects data about both single-bias and multiple-bias hate crimes. A single-bias incident is defined as an incident in which one or more offense types are motivated by the same bias. Beginning in 2013, law enforcement agencies could report up to five bias motivations per offense type. Therefore, the definition of a multiple-bias incident has been revised to “an incident in which one or more offense types are motivated by two or more biases.”

# Definitions 
# Victims
In the Hate Crime Statistics Program, the victim of a hate crime can be an individual, a business/financial institution, a government entity, a religious organization, or society/public as a whole. Law enforcement can indicate the number of individual victims, the number of victims 18 years of age and older, and the number of victims under the age of 18.
# Offenders
According to the FBI UCR Program, the term known offender does not imply the suspect’s identity is known; rather, the term indicates some aspect of the suspect was identified, thus distinguishing the suspect from an unknown offender. Law enforcement agencies specify the number of offenders (adults and juveniles) and, when possible, the race and ethnicity of the offender or offenders as a group.
# Race/ethnicity
The five racial designations in the Hate Crime Statistics Program are: White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. In addition, the FBI UCR Program uses the ethnic designations of “Hispanic or Latino” and “Not Hispanic or Latino.”
# How is Data Collected
# Data reporting
Law enforcement agencies report hate crimes brought to their attention monthly or quarterly to the FBI either through their state FBI UCR Programs or directly. These agencies submit hate crime data electronically in a NIBRS submission, the hate crime record layout, or a Microsoft® Excel Workbook Tool.
